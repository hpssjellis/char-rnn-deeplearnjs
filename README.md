1. Save the trained dataset
1. Sample the output using a seed amount of characters
1. Show the output in a second textbox

Multi-layer Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM, RNN) for character-level language models in Javascript using deeplearnjs

Inspired from  [Karpathy's char-rnn](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn).

and by   [sherjilozair char-rnn](https://github.com/sherjilozair/char-rnn-tensorflow)


Deeplearnjs github at [https://github.com/PAIR-code/deeplearnjs](https://github.com/PAIR-code/deeplearnjs)


The char-rnn was brought up as an issue at [https://github.com/PAIR-code/deeplearnjs/issues/237](https://github.com/PAIR-code/deeplearnjs/issues/237)



Just getting started on converting this to deeplearnjs

any help would be appreciated


A good starting point is to probably port the tensorflow model into your web page

Here is how to do it with Typescript
