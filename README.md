char-rnn-deeplearnjs
===
Goal: 
1. Train a Character RNN entirely in the browser, by loading the dataset using a textbox or file upload
1. (Optional or later step )Save the trained model
1. (Optional or later step )Load a test dataset
1. Run the program giving it a seed and state how many result Characters you need
1. Show the output in a second textbox

Multi-layer Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM, RNN) for character-level language models in Javascript using deeplearnjs

Inspired from  [Karpathy's char-rnn](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn).

and by   [sherjilozair char-rnn](https://github.com/sherjilozair/char-rnn-tensorflow)


Deeplearnjs github at [https://github.com/PAIR-code/deeplearnjs](https://github.com/PAIR-code/deeplearnjs)


The char-rnn was brought up as an issue at [https://github.com/PAIR-code/deeplearnjs/issues/237](https://github.com/PAIR-code/deeplearnjs/issues/237)



Just getting started on converting this to deeplearnjs

any help would be appreciated


A good starting point is to probably port the tensorflow model into your web page

Here is how to do it with Typescript
