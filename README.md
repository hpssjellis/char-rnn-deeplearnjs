char-rnn-deeplearnjs
===
Goal: 
1. Train a Character RNN entirely in the browser, by loading the dataset using a textarea or file upload or upload a presaved dataset such as the tinyshakespeare data from the data folder
1. (Optional or earlier step )Be able to download or upload the trained model. Should default to running a pre-trained pre-saved model from the saved-models folder
1. (Optional or later step )Load a test dataset and test it
1. Run the program giving it a seed of characters and state how many result characters you want as output
1. Show the output in a final textarea

Ok. Uploading and downloading files to textareas should be done with a server such as PHP or NOdejs. Just going to spend a bit of time to see if it can be done with pure javascript. The backup is to just copy and paste from a text file into the textarea.

Multi-layer Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM, RNN) for character-level language models in Javascript using deeplearnjs

Inspired from  [Karpathy's char-rnn](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn).

and by   [sherjilozair char-rnn](https://github.com/sherjilozair/char-rnn-tensorflow)


Deeplearnjs github at [https://github.com/PAIR-code/deeplearnjs](https://github.com/PAIR-code/deeplearnjs)


The char-rnn was brought up as an issue at [https://github.com/PAIR-code/deeplearnjs/issues/237](https://github.com/PAIR-code/deeplearnjs/issues/237)



Just getting started on converting this to deeplearnjs

any help would be appreciated


A good starting point is to probably port the tensorflow model into your web page

Here is how to do it with Typescript
